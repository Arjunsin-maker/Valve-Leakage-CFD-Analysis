# Valve-Leakage-CFD-Analysis
# Valve Leakage CFD Analysis 🚿🔩

This project evaluates the performance of a valve in sealing a chamber under inlet pressure conditions using SolidWorks Flow Simulation.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

- Inlet pressure: 600,000 Pa
- Chamber sealed with a valve
- Objective: Evaluate pressure retention and leakage rate

## 📊 Results

- Pressure retained: 97.63% of inlet pressure
- Mass flow leakage: 0.1525 kg/s

## 💻 Tools Used

- SolidWorks Flow Simulation
- CAD modeling in SolidWorks
- Basic post-processing and result visualization

## 📁 Files Included

- Simulation Report (PDF)
- Images of simulation result (pressure, velocity plots)
- Valve model files (optional)
